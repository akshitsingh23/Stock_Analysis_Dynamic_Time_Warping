## Project Overview
This project aims to compare the stock prices of 15 top companies, including Google, Microsoft, PayPal, P&G, and others. The comparison is performed using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to find the most similar stock price patterns and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to group the companies based on their stock price similarities.

## Features
- **Stock Price Comparison**: Analyze and compare the stock prices of 15 major companies.
- **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**: Measure the similarity between different stock price time series.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Group companies based on the similarity of their stock prices.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the stock price trends and the results of the DTW and KNN analysis.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
